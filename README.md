# FriendFinder

 The goal of this project was to create a Friend Finder app (essentially a dating app but for friends) using Node and Express servers. The user enters the page that leads to a survey. When the user answers the 10 questions and submits the survey, they are matched with a "friend" that has the closest match to their personality.
